# moral examplar

olivia is upset about humanities curriculum. the teacher is using religions of the world
to deliver the curriculum but it's just reading the bible texts without much context nor
objective analysis...

cute to hear olivia asking 'when are we going to discuss interesting things?'

- moral exemplar
- religion vs mythology
- ethics vs moral
