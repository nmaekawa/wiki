## 1st day of summer term

- restore worker we lost due to ffmpeg errors
  this was done manually...

- started to follow dev cluster launch instructions
  (need a dev cluster to test provision cleanup)
  was interrupted by debug in matterhorn

- matterhorn auth loggly messages
  mh auth connection with auth daemon refused
  - localized between 12:00 and 12:16pm today, but interlaced with successful requests to
    authMH service
  - can't find anything on cm.dce apache logs -- i think this connection refused error
    occurs before being able to log
  - tempted to file under spurious&random
  - mh auth debug messages in log are from user tracking!

- i did changed mh config.props and load/mh-default in engage to private ip (from public
  dns), this around 11:50am today
